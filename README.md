# Calculator-App – Internship Task

A clean and responsive calculator app built using **Flutter**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with proper input validation and user-friendly interface. This app was submitted as **Task 1** during my internship.

---

## ✅ Features

- Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Real-time input and result display
- Clear (`C`) button to reset input
- Shows full operation flow (e.g., `1+2+3+4`)
- Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero, `01`)
- Displays last operation in grey and current input in black
- Circular, responsive buttons
- Works on all screen sizes (mobile responsive)
- Styled app bar with centered title and custom font

---

## 📲 Technologies Used

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **UI**: Flutter Widgets (no XML used)
- **Backend Logic**: Handled inside Dart (no external backend)

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaryamKhan35/flutter-calculator.git
cd flutter-calculator

```

2. **Run the app**

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

📝 Notes
This app does not use XML because Flutter does not require it; layouts are created using widgets.

I studied Flutter in my university course, so I used it instead of Android XML.

The entire app works offline and has no backend dependency.

If you type a number like 01, it will be corrected to 1.

Division by zero will show an Error.
